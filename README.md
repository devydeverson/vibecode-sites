## 🎯 The Vibecode Philosophy

Built these in one flow. No wireframes, no planning docs, no "should I...?" 

Just:
1. Thought of something that sounded fun
2. Built it
3. Made it actually work
4. Added some style
5. Moved on to the next one

**Total time:** ~30 minutes of pure creative flow

**Lines of code:** ~800 across all three

**Frameworks used:** None. Just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS because sometimes simple is the vibe.

## 💭 What I Learned

- Creating without overthinking is liberating
- Constraints breed creativity (no frameworks = creative solutions)
- Interactive experiences are more fun than static pages
- Old aesthetics (terminal, CRT) still hit different
- Particle systems are weirdly satisfying
- CSS animations can do SO much
